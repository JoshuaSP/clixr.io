## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1:  (~1-2 days)

  We will start by creating the page/site edit view, the core of the app.  We will create all necessary rails models and controllers as well as basic Backbone Models and Collections (to be refined later).

  We will create the basic edit bar header, left-side edit buttons and icons. We will create skeleton versions of the `SiteView` and `PageView` (without reference to elements yet).

  Architecturally, there will be no router.  Because Pages and Sites can both contain elements, there will be a lot of functionality mixed in to the two. They will maintain listeners on their collections, so changes in the models can be reflected in the DOM.

  Objects will be added by passing the element collections down to the menu views, which will then perform their actions. Objects will default to being created on the page.

  We will also create an abstract `MenuView` class, of which all menus will be subclasses. We will create a skeleton `AddElementMenu` to test menu code, as well as the basic CSS and design for menus.

  Menu will have an `addMenuItems()` method which will iterate through a passed in `menuItems` option, which will be a list of key-value pairs of menu item names and functions, and it will create them and add listeners.

  We will get menus appearing on the page, and we will then push to Heroku and make sure it all works.

[Details][phase-one]

### Phase 2:  (~1-2 days)

  Today we will work on getting things on the page. We will create an abstract ElementView class, of which all element views will be subclasses. We will create skeletons of all the subclasses.

  Today we will work on getting the add element functionality to work. This means getting the SiteView, PageView, and ElementView all operational. We will create one subclass of ElementView, div. We will work on adding basic add, drag-and-drop, and resize functionality to div using interactjs.

[Details][phase-two]

### Phase 3: (~1-2 days)

  Today we will work on adding text, images, buttons, horizontal lines, and menus to the page. We will create an image load modal. We will make sure images resize properly.

[Details][phase-three]

### Phase 4: (~2 days)

  Today we will create the edit menu functionality. We will create an EditMenuView subclass of MenuView to encapsulate all the common edit menu functionality. We will create a populateMenu() function which will take in a hash of menu items and their functions, set up `<li>`s, and attach event handlers using `delegateEvents()`.

  We will create link target menus, button and menu style menus, and create some preset CSS classes for users to style their buttons and menus.

[Details][phase-four]

### Phase 5: (~1 day)

  We will implement the PageMenu, as well as the dropdown selector for selecting the page.  This will use the composite view functions of the site to swap pages, using CSS transitions.

  We will be able to add, remove, rename, and delete pages from the Page menu, and we will make sure to remove the page references from all menus/buttons on delete.

[Details][phase-five]

### Phase 6 (~2-3 days)

  We will implement save of sites created in edit view, including thumbnail creation.

  We will implement live preview of sites created in the edit view. This will be a different rails route, and will use a backbone router for navigation within the site, making backbone routes dynamically based on the titles of the sites pages.

  We will create a backbone router and new views for site/page/element to simply display the elements and give them their proper live functionality. Mainly this means enabling certain CSS properties and link functionality.

  We will create CSS swipe/fade transitions between pages in the router, based on the site transition property.

  We will implement user authentication and the sites index view, where a user can see his/her own saved sites (if logged in) as well as templates provided by clixr. The sites will be served in a 4x4 gallery, displaying the site thumbnail, and on hover will provide buttons to edit or visit the site.

  We will put a great spinner on the loading of the edit view.

  We will then implement the "live site" functionality, using code in `routes.rb` which will dynamically load all published sites under clixr.io/:published_address/.

[Details][phase-six]

### Phase 7 (~2 days)

  Using clixr.io and cute kitten pictures on the internet, we will make some absurd and fun templates that show off clixr's features. We will doubtless run into plenty of bugs in this process as well as a feature or two we really feel like we need to build.  Maybe video, maybe snap to grid. Both pretty easy.
